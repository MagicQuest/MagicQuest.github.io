i made all these gifs (for another website thing) BUT you can use them however you want idgaf

anyways yeah i made all these with like paint.net/photopea.com -> blender -> ffmpeg
lemme give you the run down

i used paint.net for the text or still images
blender for any moving parts like the spinning faze logo in faze.gif, exported that video from blender as AVI Raw
then used ffmpeg to convert the avi -> gif for good quality (ffmpeg -i )

also there are WAY too many spamton ones bruh idk what's up with that
