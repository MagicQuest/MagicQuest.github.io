yeah the file gifs were also made (in paint.net) by me (idgaf if you use them)

and the whole process went like this (lets use chrome.gif as the example):
find a reference image -> chrome logo
make a new layer and trace the logo with the colors of the image
rinse and repeat 2 more times
save all the layers individually as chrome1.png, chrome2.png, chrome3.png
use ffmpeg to stitch them together (ffmpeg -framerate 4 -i chrome%d.png chrome.gif)

ALSO txt.gif WAS THE LAZIEST FILE GIF BECAUSE I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED LOL (i just copy and pasted the last layer and made some random changes instead of redrawing the whole thing)!
